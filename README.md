## Description: 
        Refactoring the Marketing Agency's site code to increase accessibility more users and increase site optimization for search engines using semantic html tags for the divs, accessible alt img labels, and sequential/logical order of labels. Some challenges we ran into involved how the div tags changed how css style functions, specifically in regards to the <nav> tag.

    We worked through hurdles in study sessions and asked why each person chose the paths taken; challenged ideas; and made adjustments based on what we felt made the most logical sense at this time.
